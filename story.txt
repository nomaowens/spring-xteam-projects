Once upon a time, there was a wise tortoise that lived in the outskirts of Minnesota. He lived in a small motor home which faced a beautiful lake.

One day, as the wise tortoise trotted outside of his motor home, he noticed something was amiss. GASP! The lake!...

Shaokang Jiang: Little rabbit can't sleep after drinking a bag of coffee today. She went to talk to civet. She felt very happy chatting with civet, but the coffee was too strong. She was very sleepy and kept dozing off. Civet cat looks distressed. Say, you go back to sleep. I don't need to sleep at night. I'll talk tomorrow. The little rabbit yawned and nodded. The next night, the little rabbit came to look for the civet. "I had four packets of coffee today." The little rabbit's eyes are shining. Nothing to add.
